# Burp-Restaurant-management
The project on the Database of the Restaurant order and Billing system has all the information related 
to orders placed by the customer , customer details, chef and other employees and Bill (amount) details.

## Case Study: 
Database design for Restaurant order and Bill Management.

## Aim: 
Burp is a restaurant order and billing system that aims to help restaurant and customers
with Order,Booking and Billing.When a customer visits a restaurant for a meal, they choose
what they want to eat from a menu that is provided.

The case study's goal is to create a database that the restaurant can use to manage and
preserve its records of customers, receptionists, chefs, orders,bookings and bills. It includes a
unique feature providing the facility to either book a table in a particular time slot (then they will
be provided with a particular table number) or to book an order i.e. a customer can book his /her
order already and can pick the same in his given time.


## Description:

a) In a restaurant, there are many sections like receptionist, customer, bill, order food
section, chef, and menu.

b) The customer entity has the ID provided by the restaurant, its name, contact information,
and other facts. The customer then orders items from the menu with item IDs, item names, and
quantities.

c) The employees (receptionists and chefs) are given their IDs and passwords. The receptionist generates 
a bill and  each bill has a unique Bill ID associated with that particular order.

d) The chef prepares the order, which has a unique Order ID, which is then delivered to the
customer when he arrives in his booked time slot. The Receptionist then generates the bill for
the customer, which includes the order's specifics and the total amount that must be paid.



## Functionalities:

• Database stores the information details of customer like name, ID, contact details and the
order they place which includes time and date of order placed, order ID and food items present
in their order, which is then analyzed by the restaurant to prepare the order and generate the bill
according to the respective items with the important credentials of other staffs including
Receptionist and chef.

• Restaurant order and billing Management System is an online application, from which users
can easily generate a bill and manage other details of employees.

• Administrator can edit, add, delete and update the records of his/her customer and can keep a
record of most ordered dishes and bills.
